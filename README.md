The algorithms I choose were Merge and Quickshort

At start I made 5 algorithms most common (bubble, merge, quicksort, insertion) and one most uncommon(heapsort). 
When I was reading to send the code to github I notice the part that say only choose 2 algorithms and describe why you choose it. So I choose HeapSort and Quickshort.
  
I discard merge, bubble because they iterate many time because they check the all items of array by pairs and it can take  size x size iterations in bubble.

Merge and quicksort are arlgorithms that use the the principle of divide and conquer and before they start to comparing split the array a little saving time in the comparison part.


to compile you must:
1. download the file at github to your pc
2. open a console and locate to the folder where the file are.
3. write  the command "cmake ." without the quotes.
4. write the command "make" without the quotes.
5. write ./producerConsumer /path/to/InputFile /path/to/OutputFile algorithmToSort 
6. in algorithmToSort you must write quicksort or heapsort if you dont the programm tell it to you

I left the part of thread because my experience in mutithread as I say to Erika when she ask me to fill list of items that I know. But I  I'm want to let you know that always want to learn more and improve myself.
